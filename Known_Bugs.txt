When Player picks up the ship powerup the extra life isn't added in the UI

If the player has picked up an extra life and the UI shows that there is no lives left, but the variable lives is < 0 then the player will stay alive. 

If the player hadn't picked up any life powerups and runs out of lives they are then prompted by the Game Over Lose Map. 

Other known issues involve the score resetting when the player moves to the next level, and score doesn't accurately count on second level.
